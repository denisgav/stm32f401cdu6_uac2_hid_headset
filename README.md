### PCM5102a DAC

 * PCM5102A configuration inputs:
    * FLT - Filter select : Normal latency (Low) / Low latency (High)
    * DEMP - De-emphasis control for 44.1kHz sampling rate: Off (Low) / On (High)
    * XSMT - Soft mute control(1): Soft mute (Low) / soft un-mute (High)
    * FMT - Audio format selection : I2S (Low) / Left justified (High)
 * PCM5102A I2S interface:
    * SCK - System clock input
    * BCK - Audio data bit clock input
    * DIN - Audio data input
    * LRCK - Audio data word clock input
